This repository contains work on projects for the African Leadership University Machine Learning Specialization, including math concepts, supervised learning models, unsupervised learning models, and reinforcement learning models. I have highlighted a few notable projects that are representative of my ML journey so far.  You can also click on the links to each category or project directory for more information.

## [math](/math)
This directory contains projects to build up the math skills needed for Machine Learning.
* [Linear Algebra](/math/linear_algebra)
* Notable Project: [Plotting](/math/plotting)
  * This project highlights plotting with Matplotlib to visually show data. <img src="https://i.ibb.co/M8SVLpF/Screenshot-2021-06-27-10-57-48-PM.png" alt="multiple graphs" border="0"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/F3c8Tcv/Screenshot-2021-06-27-10-55-34-PM.png" alt="graph of elevation with color spectrum" border="0">
